# the Wall

Tag the Wall allows people to create, control and chat in fully onchain, self-sovereign, permissionless and immutable chats. The messages are wrapped as NFTs allowing them to be used to see activity/reputation/own their messages, with anyone able to create a Wall for their community with a simple button click, each one being unique (like a Reddit sub). Features include ENS support for all networks, multinetwork support (we currently support 5 different chains!), tipping, activity/tip balance, NFT wrapping for messages, unique Wall names with custom symbol for each wall, permissionless creation, support for optional moderation/ability to edit messages, chat to earn mechanic and more!
